# Day 2


You play several games and record the information from each game (your
puzzle input). Each game is listed with its ID number (like the 11 in
Game 11: …) followed by a semicolon-separated list of subsets of cubes
that were revealed from the bag (like 3 red, 5 green, 4 blue).

For example, the record of a few games might look like this:

    Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
    Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue
    Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red
    Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red
    Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green

In game 1, three sets of cubes are revealed from the bag (and then put
back again). The first set is 3 blue cubes and 4 red cubes; the second
set is 1 red cube, 2 green cubes, and 6 blue cubes; the third set is
only 2 green cubes.

The Elf would first like to know which games would have been possible if
the bag contained only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes?

In the example above, games 1, 2, and 5 would have been possible if the
bag had been loaded with that configuration. However, game 3 would have
been impossible because at one point the Elf showed you 20 red cubes at
once; similarly, game 4 would also have been impossible because the Elf
showed you 15 blue cubes at once. If you add up the IDs of the games
that would have been possible, you get 8.

Determine which games would have been possible if the bag had been
loaded with only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes. What
is the sum of the IDs of those games?

**AI Prompt**

How to get the sample input in the correct format?

**AI Response**

Let’s break this down into steps. First, we need to process this input
string into a more usable format. Looking at your split attempt, we can
see we need to:

1.  Split the input into individual games
2.  Extract the game ID and the cube sets for each game

Would you like to try writing some code to handle the first step? We
could start by splitting the input into lines and removing any empty
lines.

Would you like me to suggest how to do this, or would you prefer to try
it yourself first?

``` python
sample.splitlines()
```

    ['',
     'Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green',
     'Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue',
     'Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red',
     'Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red',
     'Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green']

``` python
xs = [o for o in sample.splitlines() if o]
```

``` python

    ['Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green',
     'Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue',
     'Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red',
     'Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red',
     'Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green']

``` python
[o.split(':') for o in xs]
```

    [['Game 1', ' 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green'],
     ['Game 2', ' 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue'],
     ['Game 3',
      ' 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red'],
     ['Game 4',
      ' 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red'],
     ['Game 5', ' 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green']]

``` python

```

    [' 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green',
     ' 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue',
     ' 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red',
     ' 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red',
     ' 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green']

``` python
[o.split(': ')[1] for o in xs]

     '1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red',
     '6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green']

**AI Prompt**

now where are we?

**AI Response**

Looking at where we are now, we have a list `xs` where each item
represents one game’s cube sets, with the “Game X:” part removed. For
example, the first game is now:
`'3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green'`

The next step would be to: 1. Split each game into its individual sets
(separated by semicolons) 2. Parse each set to count the number of cubes
of each color

Would you like to try handling the semicolon split first? We can use the
`.split(';')` method on each game string.

Would you like to try that, or would you like some guidance?

``` python
for games in xs:
    print(games.split(';'))
```

    ['3 blue, 4 red', ' 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue', ' 2 green']
    ['1 blue, 2 green', ' 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red', ' 1 green, 1 blue']
    ['8 green, 6 blue, 20 red', ' 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green', ' 5 green, 1 red']
    ['1 green, 3 red, 6 blue', ' 3 green, 6 red', ' 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red']
    ['6 red, 1 blue, 3 green', ' 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green']

**AI Prompt**

then what’s next

**AI Response**

Now we need to parse each set to count the cubes of each color. Looking
at a single set like ‘3 blue, 4 red’, we need to: 1. Split by comma 2.
Extract the number and color from each part

Let’s try with one set first to make sure we understand it. Would you
like to try splitting one of these by comma and see what we get? We
could use something like:

``` python
xs[0].split(';')[0]  # This gets the first set of the first game
```

Would you like to try that?

``` python
xs[0].split(';')[0]
```

    '3 blue, 4 red'

``` python
x = xs[0].split(';')[0]
```

``` python
x.split(',')
```

    ['3 blue', ' 4 red']

**AI Prompt**

then what’s next

**AI Response**

Now we have items like ‘3 blue’ and ’ 4 red’. We need to: 1. Split each
of these into the number and color 2. Remove any extra spaces

Let’s try with one of these strings. Would you like to try splitting ‘3
blue’ into its number and color components? You can use the `.strip()`
method to remove extra spaces first.

Would you like to try that?

``` python
x1 = x.split(', ')
```

``` python
x1
```

    ['3 blue', '4 red']

**AI Prompt**

what’s next

**AI Response**

Now we can split each item like ‘3 blue’ into its number and color. We
can use `.split()` again since they’re separated by a space. Let’s try
with the first item:

Would you like to try splitting `x1[0]` into its number and color parts?
Then we can convert the number part to an integer using `int()`.

Would you like to try that?

``` python
x1[0].split(' ')
```

    ['3', 'blue']

**AI Prompt**

what’s next

**AI Response**

Perfect! Now we can create a small dictionary to store the count for
each color. For each game, we’ll need to: 1. Track the maximum number
seen for each color 2. Compare those maximums against our limits (12
red, 13 green, 14 blue)

Would you like to try creating a dictionary for the first set of cubes?
We could use something like this structure:

``` python
{'red': count, 'blue': count, 'green': count}
```

Would you like to try that?

``` python
single = x1[0].split(' ')
```

``` python
single
```

    ['3', 'blue']

``` python
dict(key=single[1],value=single[0])
```

    {'key': 'blue', 'value': '3'}

``` python
dict(single[1]=single[0])
```

      Cell In[1], line 1
        dict(single[1]=single[0])
             ^
    SyntaxError: expression cannot contain assignment, perhaps you meant "=="?

**AI Prompt**

how to make it to be dictionary?

**AI Response**

To create a dictionary from our color and number, we have a few options.
Here’s one way:

``` python
{single[1]: int(single[0])}
```

This will create a dictionary with the color as the key and the number
(converted to integer) as the value.

Would you like to try that? Then we can look at how to combine multiple
colors into one dictionary.

``` python
{single[1]:single[0]}
```

    {'blue': '3'}

**AI Prompt**

what’s next

**AI Response**

Now we need to handle both parts of `x1` (both the blue and red cubes)
in a single dictionary. We can: 1. Create an empty dictionary 2. Add
each color-number pair to it

Would you like to try creating an empty dictionary and adding both
colors from `x1`? Here’s how we could start:

``` python
cubes = {}
```

Would you like to try adding the colors and their counts to this
dictionary?

``` python
x1
```

    ['3 blue', '4 red']

``` python
cubes={}
for o in x1:
    single = o.split(' ')
    single_dict = {single[1]:single[0]}
```

``` python
single_dict
```

    {'red': '4'}

**AI Prompt**

how to add to the empty dict?

**AI Response**

To add items to a dictionary, we use the update() method or direct
assignment. Here’s how we can modify your code:

``` python
cubes = {}
for o in x1:
    single = o.split(' ')
    cubes[single[1]] = int(single[0])  # Using direct assignment
```

Or using update():

``` python
cubes = {}
for o in x1:
    single = o.split(' ')
    cubes.update({single[1]: int(single[0])})
```

Would you like to try one of these approaches? I also added `int()` to
convert the numbers from strings to integers.

``` python
cubes={}
for o in x1:
    single = o.split(' ')
    cubes[single[1]] = single[0]
```

``` python
cubes
```

    {'blue': '3', 'red': '4'}

**AI Prompt**

what’s next?

**AI Response**

Now we need to do this for each set of cubes in a game, and keep track
of the maximum number seen for each color. We should:

1.  First convert those string numbers to integers using `int()`
2.  Then apply this to all sets in a game (remember each game has
    multiple sets separated by semicolons)
3.  Track the maximum number for each color

Would you like to try modifying your code to use `int()` first? Then we
can work on handling multiple sets.

``` python
cubes={}
for o in x1:
    single = o.split(' ')
    cubes[single[1]] = int(single[0])
```

``` python
cubes
```

    {'blue': 3, 'red': 4}

**AI Prompt**

what’s next?

**AI Response**

Now let’s work on handling all sets in a game. Remember that each game
string in `xs` has multiple sets separated by semicolons. Let’s:

1.  Take the first game from `xs` and process all its sets
2.  Keep track of the maximum number for each color across all sets

Would you like to try getting all the sets from the first game using
`.split(';')`? We can start with:

``` python
game = xs[0]  # First game
```

Would you like to try that and see what sets we get?

``` python
game = xs[0]
```

``` python
game
```

    '3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green'

``` python
for g in game.split('; '):
    print(g.split(', '))
```

    ['3 blue', '4 red']
    ['1 red', '2 green', '6 blue']
    ['2 green']

``` python
def get_single_dict(single):
    cubes={}
    for o in single:
        single = o.split(' ')
        cubes[single[1]] = int(single[0])
    return cubes

get_single_dict(['3 blue', '4 red'])
```

    {'blue': 3, 'red': 4}

``` python
for g in game.split('; '):
    single = g.split(', ')
    print(get_single_dict(single))
```

    {'blue': 3, 'red': 4}
    {'red': 1, 'green': 2, 'blue': 6}
    {'green': 2}

**AI Prompt**

what’s next?

**AI Response**

Now we need to track the maximum number seen for each color across all
sets in a game. We’ll need to:

1.  Create a dictionary to store the maximum values
2.  For each set, compare its values with our current maximums and
    update if needed

Would you like to try creating a dictionary to track the maximums? We
can start with something like:

``` python
max_cubes = {'red': 0, 'green': 0, 'blue': 0}
```

Then we’ll need to update these values as we process each set. Would you
like to try that?

``` python
max_cubes = {'red': 0, 'green': 0, 'blue': 0}
```

**AI Prompt**

how to update max_cubes dictionary with value?

**AI Response**

To update max_cubes with the maximum value for each color, we can use
the `max()` function. For each set, we’ll want to:

1.  Compare the current value with the new value
2.  Take the larger of the two

Here’s one way to do it:

``` python
current_set = {'blue': 3, 'red': 4}  # example set
for color in current_set:
    max_cubes[color] = max(max_cubes[color], current_set[color])
```

Would you like to try this with your code? We can then check if it’s
updating the maximums correctly.

``` python
max_cubes = {'red': 0, 'green': 0, 'blue': 0}
for g in game.split('; '):
    single = g.split(', ')
    single_dict = get_single_dict(single)
    for color in single_dict:
        max_cubes[color] = max(max_cubes[color],single_dict[color])
```

``` python
max_cubes
```

    {'red': 4, 'green': 2, 'blue': 6}

**AI Prompt**

what’s next?

**AI Response**

Now we need to:

1.  Put this logic into a function that processes a single game
2.  Compare the maximum values against our limits (12 red, 13 green, 14
    blue)
3.  Apply this to all games in `xs` and sum up the IDs of possible games

Would you like to start by creating a function that processes a single
game and returns whether it’s possible? We can use our existing code as
a starting point.

Would you like to try that?

``` python
require_cubes = {'red':12,'green':13, 'blue':14}
```

**AI Prompt**

how to compare the values between max_cubes and require_cubes?

**AI Response**

To compare values between max_cubes and require_cubes, we need to check
if each color in max_cubes is less than or equal to the required amount.
Here’s one way:

``` python
for color in max_cubes:
    if max_cubes[color] > require_cubes[color]:
        return False
return True
```

Or we could use the all() function:

``` python
all(max_cubes[color] <= require_cubes[color] for color in max_cubes)
```

Would you like to try one of these approaches to check if a game is
possible?

``` python
def compare_require(max_cubes,require_cubes):
    for color in max_cubes:
        if max_cubes[color] > require_cubes[color]:
            return False
    return True
```

``` python
compare_require(max_cubes,require_cubes)
```

    True

``` python
def get_max_cubes(game):
    max_cubes = {'red': 0, 'green': 0, 'blue': 0}
    for g in game.split('; '):
        single = g.split(', ')
        single_dict = get_single_dict(single)
        for color in single_dict:
            max_cubes[color] = max(max_cubes[color],single_dict[color])
    return max_cubes
```

``` python
game
```

    '3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green'

``` python
get_max_cubes(game)
```

    {'red': 4, 'green': 2, 'blue': 6}

``` python

**AI Prompt**

what’s next?

**AI Response**

Now we need to:

1.  Keep track of the game IDs (remember games are numbered from 1 to 5
    in our example)
2.  Sum up the IDs of only the possible games (where compare_require
    returns True)

Would you like to modify the loop to include the game ID and sum up the
valid game IDs? We can use enumerate() to get both the index and the
game value.

Would you like to try that?

``` python
for index, game in enumerate(xs,start=1):print(index)
```

    1
    2

    max_cubes = get_max_cubes(game)
    if compare_require(max_cubes,require_cubes):
        index_sum.append(index)

index_sum
```

    [1, 2, 5]

``` python
index_sum = 0
for index, game in enumerate(xs,start=1):
    max_cubes = get_max_cubes(game)

## Part 2

As you continue your walk, the Elf poses a second question: in each game
you played, what is the fewest number of cubes of each color that could
have been in the bag to make the game possible?

Again consider the example games from earlier:

    Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
    Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue
    Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red
    Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red
    Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green

In game 1, the game could have been played with as few as 4 red, 2
green, and 6 blue cubes. If any color had even one fewer cube, the game
would have been impossible. Game 2 could have been played with a minimum
of 1 red, 3 green, and 4 blue cubes. Game 3 must have been played with
at least 20 red, 13 green, and 6 blue cubes. Game 4 required at least 14
red, 3 green, and 15 blue cubes. Game 5 needed no fewer than 6 red, 3
green, and 2 blue cubes in the bag. The power of a set of cubes is equal
to the numbers of red, green, and blue cubes multiplied together. The
power of the minimum set of cubes in game 1 is 48. In games 2-5 it was
12, 1560, 630, and 36, respectively. Adding up these five powers
produces the sum 2286.

**AI Prompt**

given a dictionary like “{‘red’: 4, ‘green’: 2, ‘blue’: 6}”, how to get
the number multiply together?

**AI Response**

To multiply the values in a dictionary together, you can use either a
loop or the `math.prod()` function with dictionary values. Here’s a
simple way:

``` python
d = {'red': 4, 'green': 2, 'blue': 6}
result = 1
for value in d.values():
    result *= value
```

Or more concisely:

``` python
from math import prod
result = prod(d.values())
```

Would you like to try one of these approaches?

``` python
single_dict
```

    {'green': 2}

``` python
max_cubes
```

    {'red': 15, 'green': 8, 'blue': 1}

``` python
max_cubes.values()
```

    dict_values([15, 8, 1])

``` python
from math import prod
prod(max_cubes.values())
```

    120

``` python
product_sum = 0
for game in out:
    max_cubes = get_max_cubes(game)
    product = prod(max_cubes.values())
    product_sum+=product
product_sum
```
